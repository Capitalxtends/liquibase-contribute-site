# Extension Guides

Once you have learned the basics of Liquibase Extensions in the [HelloWorldChange](../your-first-extension.html) sample, 
it's time to build some real-world extensions. 

While the [Extension Capabilities](../capabilities.html) section offers high-level overviews of what an extension can do, 
this section contains a list of detailed code guides and samples that explains how to write a specific extension.

In each guide or sample, you can expect to find:

- Thoroughly commented source code
- An example showing the usage of the sample extension
- Listing of APIs being used
- Explanation of API concepts

## Guides & Samples

Here are the available guides, including the APIs they use
