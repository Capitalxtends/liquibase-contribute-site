# Creating a Pull Request

## Contributing Etiquette

Please see our [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md){:target="_blank"} for information on our rules of conduct.

## Requirements

Before creating a pull request, please read our requirements that explains the minimal details to have your PR considered and merged into the codebase.

1. PRs should reference a existing issue(s) that describes the issue or feature being submitted. A PR should be about the "how" not the "what", but for code cleanup/refactoring/quick-bugfixes the PR can be self-contained and not reference an issue.
2. PRs must have the description template filled out, describing the changes you are making and why plus choices and considerations you made.
3. PRs must include tests covering the changed behavior or a description of why tests cannot be written.

!!! Note
    We appreciate you taking the time to contribute! 

    Before submitting a pull request, please take the time to comment on the issue you are wanting to resolve. 
    This helps us prevent duplicate effort or advise if the team is already addressing the issue.
