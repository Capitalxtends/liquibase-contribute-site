# Integration Guides

Once you have [Liquibase added to your application](../integrations-overview/dev-env-setup.md), it's time to build your
real-world integration.

In each guide or sample, you can expect to find:

- Thoroughly commented source code
- An example showing the usage of the sample extension
- Listing of APIs being used
- Explanation of API concepts
