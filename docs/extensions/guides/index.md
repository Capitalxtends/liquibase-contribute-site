# Extension Guides

Once you have learned the basics of Liquibase Extensions in the [HelloWorldChange](../your-first-extension.md)
sample,
it's time to build some real-world extensions.

In each guide or sample, you can expect to find:

- Thoroughly commented source code
- An example showing the usage of the sample extension
- Listing of APIs being used
- Explanation of API concepts

Here are the available guides, including the APIs they use
