# Extension Guides

Once you have learned the basics of Liquibase Extensions in the [HelloWorldChange](/extensions/your-first-extension)

it's time to build some real-world extensions.

In each guide or sample, you can expect to find:

- Thoroughly commented source code
- An example showing the usage of the sample extension
- Listing of APIs being used
